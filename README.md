# GAN Integrity backend code challenge (NestJS solution)

This is my NestJS solution to the GAN Integrity backend coding challenge. Note that I also created a [separate solution for Express, koa and bun](https://github.com/Snater/backend-code-challenge).

I am not affiliated with GAN Integrity, I have never received a response from them regarding my submitted solution. I am just using the opportunity to try out different approaches solving the challenge.

## Solution instructions

1. Run `npm i`.
2. Start the NestJS server, i.e. per `npm run start:server`.
3. In a separate terminal, run the challenge script `npm start`.

## Tests

In addition to the solution, some basic tests are implemented. They may be executed per `npm test` and `npm run test:e2e`.

## Original instructions

>
>The script `index.js` uses a local api to perform various operations on a set of cities. Your task is to implement an api so that the script runs successfully all the way to the end.
>
>Run `npm install` and `npm run start` to start the script.
>
>Your api can load the required data from [here](addresses.json).
>
>In the distance calculations you can assume the earth is a perfect sphere and has a radius is 6371 km.
>
>Once you are done, please provide us with a link to a git repo with your code, ready to run.
